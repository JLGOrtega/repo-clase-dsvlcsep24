For the calculation:\n","\n","- Join the product root code table to the stock movements table.\n","\n","  **IMPORTANT**: products with stock movements that do not have a root code assigned must be deleted.\n","\n","- Group the table by product root code, store and date, adding the units. Example:  \n","\n","   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7293776/145417614-6a682746-51cf-4f5b-a788-7424bae37e88.png)\n","\n","- Accumulate the stock movements to obtain the stock on that date, by product root code, store and date level. Example:\n","\n","   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7293776/145417461-1445d2c4-25f4-4a56-9314-a0d16af353ba.png)\n","\n","- Calculate the initial stock of each product root code - store on 01/01/2019 and maintain the dates after 01/01/2019 and its stock. Example:\n","\n","   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7293776/145417374-acb7fa79-08e2-48a8-ad4a-38df3a579e7f.png)\n","\n","In the following cases the key, store - product root codes, can be removed from the table:\n","\n","- With only initial stock and value 0, since they have no stock from 2019, the case of the example in store 2.\n","- With negative stock on all dates, the case of the example in store 1.\n","\n","The customer asks us for the above information in two formats:\n","\n","- For each product root code - store, the date ranges and the stock in that range. the date, 31/12/2020, is considered as the last date.

Therefore, only one interval appears, from 01/01/2019 to 26/10/2019.\n","\n","The intervals with negative stock or 0 are removed from the table.\n","\n","A .parquet file named ***interval_stock*** will be delivered.\n","\n","- The daily stock propagated to all dates.
